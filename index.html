	<h2>I am a data analyst. I have experience with data visualization, statistical modeling, and survey research.</h2>
	<p>I recently graduated with a B.S. in statistical science from Brigham Young University with minors in political science and mathematics. While in school, I worked on sports analytics and international development projects as a research assistant in the statistics and political science departments respectively. I enjoy running, film photography, and doom-scrolling on Twitter.</p>
