title: Who am I?
---

#### I am a data analyst with experience in data visualization, statistical modeling, and survey research.

I recently graduated with a B.S. in statistical science from Brigham Young University with minors in political science and mathematics. While in school, I worked on sports analytics and international development projects as a research assistant in the statistics and political science departments respectively. I enjoy running, cycling, and film photography.
