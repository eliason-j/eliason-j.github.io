<p>Creating this website has been on my list of things to do for an embarrassingly long time. I worked on it in fits&ndash;first in July 2020 and again recently when I started over using Hugo and <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">bookdown</a> in order to more easily accommodate <code>.Rmd</code> files. Now that it&rsquo;s finally live, I thought I&rsquo;d say a couple things about what I hope to accomplish here.</p>

<h4 id="having-a-website-that-showcases-personal-data-projects-seems-useful-to-my-professional-development">Having a website that showcases personal data projects seems useful to my professional development.</h4>
<p>My professional work is off-limits to this medium because it&rsquo;s mostly the intellectual property of my current and past employers. What I show here is limited to just some personal projects I&rsquo;ve worked on over the years. That said, there&rsquo;s still value there. I like the idea of being able to communicate some basic competence as a data practitioner alongside more of my personality than a resume would show.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="i-want-to-do-better-work-sharing-projects-helps-me-to-do-the-last-mile-of-cleaning-and-summary">I want to do better work. Sharing projects helps me to do the last mile of cleaning and summary.</h4>
<p>A motif: I get excited about an idea, I get far enough to scratch the itch, I maybe find something genuinely interesting (or not), and I move on. Making projects legible to other people requires me to do some boring-but-important stuff (code-cleaning, plot-formatting, and summary-writing) before moving on. Considering the boring stuff is the difference between people having access to the rest of work I&rsquo;ve already done or not seeing any of it at all, it&rsquo;s time well-spent.</p>
<h4 id="writing-as-thinkingi-want-to-think-better">&ldquo;Writing as thinking&rdquo;—I want to think better.</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot lately about writing as a bulwark against distraction. The internet seems to warp my attention span and rob me of my ability to think critically. Writing seems to restore those things. It unclutters my mind,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> exposes whether individual thoughts have substance, and helps me remember stuff I wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Probably the highest-order reason for having a website in the present is that I&rsquo;d like to use this space to practice writing.</p>
<h4 id="im-trying-to-follow-my-curiosity">I&rsquo;m trying to follow my curiosity.</h4>
<p>I think fairly often about Elizabeth Gilbert&rsquo;s perhaps-cliche <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/351554044">advice</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We keep telling people to follow their passion. And I feel like that can be an intimidating and almost cruel thing to say to people at times because first of all, if somebody has one central, powerful, burning passion, they&rsquo;re probably already following it because that&rsquo;s sort of the definition of passion - is that you don&rsquo;t have a choice. If you don&rsquo;t - which is a lot of people, have one central, burning, passion and somebody tells you to follow your passion, I think you have the right to give them the finger because it just makes you feel worse. And so I always say to people, forget it. Like, if you don&rsquo;t have an obvious passion, forget about it. Follow your curiosity because passion is sort of a tower of flame that is not always accessible. And curiosity is something that anybody can access any day. Your curiosity may lead you to your passion or may it not. It may have been for, air quotes, nothing, in which case all you&rsquo;ve done your entire life is spend your existence in pursuit of the things that made you feel curious and inspired and that should be good enough.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel curious about starting a blog; here I am.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>The professional motivation for this space is long-standing and probably goes without further explanation. Since my recent interest and motivation in re-booting this project came from reading other people&rsquo;s thoughts about thinking and writing. I thought I&rsquo;d share a handful of those.</p>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/">writing as thinking</a> (emphasis added):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You probably had experience learning some math or physics or whatever else where you listen to the lecturer and you understand everything perfectly and then you try to actually solve the problem and you realize that you have no idea how to do it. <strong>This is the way thinking and everything else in the world works.</strong> You can read all the self-help books in the world. You can read all the blog posts in the world. It’s not enough. Good thinking doesn’t happen by passive osmosis of other people’s good thinking. You have to actually write essays and journals to debug yourself and your ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The same thought expressed by <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/selfish-writing/">someone else</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Good writers don’t walk around all day with 100,000 words of eloquent wisdom in their heads. No one can do that. They take some vague feeling they’ve been thinking about, dig into a bunch, write down what they’ve discovered, realize half of it doesn’t make sense, delete most of it, write some more, realize the new stuff contradicts itself, panic when they realize they don’t understand the topic as well as they thought they did, talk to other smart people about why that is, learn something new that reminds them of this other thing that might tie into the second paragraph, discover that this thing they believed before they started writing isn’t actually true, realize that if that thing isn’t true then this other thing is probably really important, and so on endlessly.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>On <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210221013/https://ava.substack.com/p/effort">attention</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>My attention naturally works best in targeted bursts. It&rsquo;s like a tractor beam: intensely focused on one thing while leaving everything else in complete darkness. This form of attention is both effective and flawed: it means that I can summon tremendous amounts of energy for a short duration and direct it towards whatever I&rsquo;m obsessed with. When the obsession fades, however, it becomes significantly harder for me to remain interested in the task at hand. Of course, any long-term project requires sustained interest through weeks and months of boredom and hopelessness. As a result, I&rsquo;ve become convinced in the past couple of years that I need to get better at maintenance: attending to the same thing over and over and over, even when I experience the work as rather less than thrilling.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The spirit of this quote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201109040947/https://www.mensjournal.com/features/anthony-bourdains-life-advice-20140919/">from Anthony Bourdain</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand there’s a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons and watch old movies. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid and outwit that guy.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210210032248/https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/#cold-emails-and-twitter">practical consideration</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;having a blog may be useful as a way to demonstrate that you think well when you e.g. send cold emails&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210124202626/http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/docs/pdf/Article_86.pdf">This</a>, about how technical writing is technical work:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course the premise that content and expression are separable is wrong. The production function for scholarship cannot be written as the sum of two sub-functions, one producing &ldquo;results&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;writing them up.&rdquo; The function is not separable. You do not learn the details of an argument until writing it up in detail, and in writing up the details you will often uncover a flaw in the fundamentals.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Wait, so is this website for your portfolio or for writing?</em> Yes :) It will definitely be the former and I hope it will be the latter, but I&rsquo;m waiting to commit to a rigid identity until I get a few posts down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why not show your portfolio here and keep a journal for the rest?</em> I&rsquo;m pretty unattached to whether people actually see this, so on its face this thought felt persuasive for a while. However, writing semi-publicly feels like a useful commitment device. My hypothesis is that I&rsquo;ll write (and think) better and more frequently in an environment like this versus in my notes app. Additionally, I definitely get something less-easily defined out of the ability to polish, publish, and collate all of my projects and ideas in a single location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What if your ideas are stupid, your projects are childish, and putting them on a public-facing platform exposes you for the loser you&rsquo;ve always been?</em> This is a fair question and in fact I do worry about this! I make no promises about the quality of the content here!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-parting">In parting</h2>
<p>Probably the most validating experience for moving forward with this project has been the experience of typing up the thoughts on this page. Explained: I do not consider myself to be a &ldquo;good writer.&rdquo; Writing takes me a long time and I basically never feel pride for the work I produce. This post has been case in point—it took me several hours out of my Presidents&rsquo; Day to hash out less than a thousand of my own words about what I think&ndash;and the final product still feels pretty rough! I haven&rsquo;t produced anything special, but on the other hand the process did in fact really help me! I now understand more clearly what I want out of this and my reasons for being here. There&rsquo;s no way I would have spent as much time or worked as hard at parsing out what I really think if it weren&rsquo;t for this outlet, and that feels like a decent thought to move forward with.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out with thoughts or feedback, if you have any.</p>

<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is more of a thought for another time, but sometimes I get hit with a wave of terror about how I forget almost everything I don&rsquo;t engage with. I joke sometimes about how I&rsquo;d probably use a version of <a href="https://letterboxd.com">Letterboxd</a> for pretty much every dimension of my life if I could, if just to keep my experiences from slipping into the void. There&rsquo;s something about logging movies and writing a thought or two about them that seems to add a lot of value to the experience of watching a movie for me. I love the idea of doing the same for recipes used, vacations taken, games played. I&rsquo;d have a hard time articulating a coherent valued reason for feeling that way or why it matters to remember anything I do at all but whatever the reason, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeHClAkXsAAmjx4.jpg">it compels me</a>. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I have to say, I do sort of recoil at the word &ldquo;blog.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because blogs are out of vogue or because I don&rsquo;t want whatever layer of implicit meaning that adds. I just want to host my projects and be accountable for writing. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
