      <description>Raison d&amp;rsquo;Ãªtre Creating this website has been on my list of things to do for an embarrassingly long time. I worked on it in fits&amp;ndash;first in July 2020 and again recently when I started over using Hugo and bookdown in order to more easily accommodate .Rmd files. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s finally live, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d say a couple things about what I hope to accomplish here.
Having a website that showcases personal data projects seems useful to my professional development.</description>

      <description>I am a data analyst with experience in data visualization, statistical modeling, and survey research. I recently graduated with a B.S. in statistical science from Brigham Young University with minors in political science and mathematics. While in school, I worked on sports analytics and international development projects as a research assistant in the statistics and political science departments respectively. I enjoy running, cycling, and film photography.</description>
