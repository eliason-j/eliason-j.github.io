One small silver lining of this long COVID summer is that I've had a little more time to catch up on my to-do list. Setting up a space where I can post thoughts and highlight some of my personal projects has been on that list for a long time.

So here we are.

It's not much, but it's mine, and I am anticipating populating this space in the near future. Stay tuned.
